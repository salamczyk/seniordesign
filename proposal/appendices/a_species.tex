\chapter{Executive Summary}
\label{apdx:Summary}
Stephen Lamczyk (CpE), Jacob Strother (EE), Seth Cummings (EE), and Zephaniah Amonoo-Harrison (CpE) were the group members for this project. Megan Witherow was the PhD student advisor while Dr. Khan Iftekharuddin was the faculty advisor. The goal of this project is to program two NAO robots to simulate an autism intervention situation. One NAO robot simulates the autistic child and the other tries to move it to a desired state. Our results so far have proved that there are many different effective ways for the robots to communicate with each other. We program these robots using the Choregraphe and the NAOqi. This has applications in autism intervention. Of course, the modules that we design will have to be modified for this to work with a real child.  \par
