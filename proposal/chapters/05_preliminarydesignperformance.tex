\chapter{Preliminary Design Performance}
\label{ch:preliminarydesignperformance}

Some testing is naturally required to test whether our design, so far, is effective. So far, the robots are capable of recognizing and classifying the eye color of the other robot. This is important as this eye color is one of the ways we will communicate robot moods. Additionally, these robots are also capable of recognizing the voice of the other robot. This is also an important part in our proposed communication system between the robots. \par
